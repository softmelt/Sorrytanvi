<h2>An Honest Sorry 💔</h2>
<p>
I want to talk to you properly and honestly.
I’m truly sorry for what I did. Singing that song for Nishka was a mistake,
and I understand that it hurt you.
</p>
<p>
Even if my intention wasn’t to hurt you,
I realize now that my actions did.
And for that, I am genuinely sorry.

<h2>Why You Are Special 💖</h2>
<p>
You are one of the most genuine people I know.
Your kindness, honesty, and the way you care about others is rare.
</p>
<p>
You make people feel comfortable just by being yourself.
Your smile has a way of making bad days feel lighter.
</p>
<p>
Having you as my best friend is something I truly value.

<section class="card slide-up delay-2">
<h2>A Promise 🤍</h2>
<p>
I promise to be more thoughtful with my actions.
I never want to make you feel ignored, hurt, or unimportant.
</p>
<p>
You matter to me — more than I sometimes know how to say.
